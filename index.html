                Every year I go into VSCode, into the command palette >
                Snippets: Configure User Snippets, and I finally acknowledge the
                year has gone by through changing the year on my MIT license for
                projects. This year, I decided to celebrate by applying that
                2023 license on something interesting.

                        To me, the hardest part of a project is always starting
                        out. As such, I was extremely worried about how this
                        drawing would turn out, as it would set in motion a
                        framework for the remainder of this challenge.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In this case I was especially worried - It's my first
                        time messing with HTML5 canvases, so things had to work
                        properly. Unfortunately, I ended up struggling a lot,
                        both due to basic mathematical errors and canvas
                        orientation being confusing by nature.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After browsing the internet for a bit I stumbled upon an
                        interesting video of a series of dots moving in straight
                        lines. These dots would individually move in simple
                        motions, but together they would form a complex pattern.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The effect turned out nice, though I couldn't perfectly
                        synchronize the dots together. I like the folding and
                        unfolding nature of the current design, though.
                        Different winding angles change the way the points
                        rotate in the code.
