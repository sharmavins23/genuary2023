                Every year I go into VSCode, into the command palette >

                year has gone by through changing the year on my MIT license for
                projects. This year, I decided to celebrate by applying that
                2023 license on something interesting.

                As the days of January roll over, I'll be adding more and more
                here, so check back occasionally. I might do some early or some
                late, though. Still, I hope you enjoy some of these projects, as
                I personally enjoyed implementing them. Thank you for viewing!

                    <p>
                        To me, the hardest part of a project is always starting
                        out. As such, I was extremely worried about how this
                        drawing would turn out, as it would set in motion a
                        framework for the remainder of this challenge.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In this case I was especially worried - It's my first
                        time messing with HTML5 canvases, so things had to work
                        properly. Unfortunately, I ended up struggling a lot,
                        both due to basic mathematical errors and canvas
                        orientation being confusing by nature.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After browsing the internet for a bit I stumbled upon an
                        interesting video of a series of dots moving in straight
                        lines. These dots would individually move in simple
                        motions, but together they would form a complex pattern.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The effect turned out nice, though I couldn't perfectly
                        synchronize the dots together. I like the folding and
                        unfolding nature of the current design, though.
                        Different winding angles change the way the points
                        rotate in the code.

                        Not sure whose idea it was to make the literal second
                        prompt of the year an extreme hardball, but, here we
                        are.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I'm pretty sure it's not cheating if the framework is
                        made outside of the 10 minutes. Still, I'm learning, so
                        there's that!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Though, I do have to admit, I did cheat a little. I went
                        for about 11 minutes before realizing that the time was
                        over. Time flies when you're coding things!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I really wanted to continue this and add some form of
                        background, or maybe some other colors. My original idea
                        was to have dots that would expand and blur out, similar
                        to how it looks visually when you screenshare a
                        screenshare. However, instead of this image degradation
                        effect, I effectively just got a raindrop bokeh.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        GitHub Copilot was by FAR the most valuable tool when
                        writing this. I would have never finished this effect on
                        time without it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I ended up adding some finishing touches after the timer
                        ended, just to make the effect look neater.

                        My initial thoughts of this prompt were simply: "Woah,
                        this has potential. I can't wait to ruin that!"
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My idea was to create some form of Outrun-esque
                        structure, and add glitches to get the desired effect.
                        However, I wasn't exactly sure how I would implement
                        "glitches" or "bugs", so I had to improvise. I also
                        turned down the FPS of this display, which actually
                        helped a lot to give a retro/old unpolished computer
                        feel.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        While drawing certain things I noticed that I needed a
                        3D-esque feel. Rather than doing the math, I knee-jerk
                        asked Copilot to design something. It made something so
                        ugly that it looked like a genuine glitch, so I made
                        those occur on a very low chance and kept them in. The
                        "buildings" add this interesting effect - They pop in
                        and out, and sometimes are removed entirely!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I love how pseudo-interactive this design is. There's an
                        extremely small random chance for buildings to disappear
                        entirely, and that disappearance is tied to an extremely
                        small intermittent glitch. Potentially, all of the
                        buildings can disappear!

                    <p>
                        Borrowing the concepts from the day before, I wanted to
                        generate some form of dynamic intersection art. So, I
                        had the idea of spawning two random points (with random
                        velocities), and making intersections occur.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This is actually the first big "failure" art piece I
                        implemented, and I fiddled around with getting it to
                        work for a while. Basically, I was checking collisions
                        or intersections by checking the pixel data at the next
                        point, but certain random trajectories would screw this
                        up. I tried reimplementing it with a grid of known
                        positions, but that didn't work either - Unfortunately,
                        HTML5 canvas is not pixel-based, and will take in
                        floating points as well, so the structure fell apart
                        quickly.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Still, I quite like the effect! Points will bounce
                        around, and at a certain point when there's enough on
                        the screen the piece will devolve into pure chaos
                        quickly.

                        This one was by far a no-brainer. I spent a lot of time
                        in the prior days logging things to the console, so I
                        figured I would just make a wrapper for logging and
                        print out any log statements into this block.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The prior implementations were all done with HTML5
                        Canvas, so this was the first major departure from that
                        structure. This entire portion instead utilized a div,
                        but injected information via JavaScript. It also had
                        separate CSS, which was an interesting addition.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This also meant that I had to rewrite logging messages
                        into my prior implementations, which was an interesting
                        task, to say the least.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I quite like the idea that this piece is basically not
                        "art" in the general sense; However, it will still
                        evolve alongside more and more pieces being added in the
                        future, which I think is extremely cool.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It's also relatively quirky, and faithful to the prompt,
                        which I think is a great thing overall.

                        For the sake of full transparency, I have never *once*
                        attempted to mess with artificial intelligence. However,
                        the prompt is so obviously related to artificial
                        intelligence, so I figured out it was high time I tried.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As such, I decided to attempt to get started via a
                        Neural Style Transfer implementation. As I had never
                        worked with artificial intelligence before, I was
                        "stealing" the entire procedure as well (credits are in
                        the source code!)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        By technicality, this means that I didn't follow the
                        prompt - I'm stealing like a programmer, not like an
                        artist. But, with the recent debate over digitally
                        generated art pieces, I think this falls in line with
                        the spirit of the prompt, at least.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Upon clicking, the site will select two random images,
                        one for the content and one for the style. The style of
                        the style image will be transferred to the other image,
                        thus generating a new image in the style of the artist.
                    </p>

                        This day was by far the biggest headache I've ever
                        encountered, particularly due to the fact that the guide
                        was extremely poorly documented. I had to spend a lot of
                        time in sandboxes debugging memory leaks.

                    <p>
                        My favorite album is probably Chronologist's Equinox II,
                        though I'm entirely not sure (and that's up for debate).
                        Rather than sampling a color from that palette, I wanted
                        to create code such that you, the viewer, could sample
                        colors from YOUR favorite palette, and I could create a
                        Chronologist-esque album cover using it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To do this, I first had to crudely make an album cover
                        that looked like the Chronologist album. I added some
                        interesting features to the album in an attempt to
                        "personalize" it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This was the first project where the code actually
                        leaves the 500x500 box - I have a form submit
                        underneath. The form submit seems to have some latency,
                        though, so it's staggered (when you upload the next
                        file, it starts working properly - Weird async
                        JavaScript that I don't want to debug!)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I like the output, and for a lot of input images it
                        actually looks pretty nice.

                    <p>
                        Special thanks to Piter Pasma for the explanation about
                        signed distance functions, since these are something I
                        have never messed with. This actually sparked my
                        interest in applying more numerical methods to this
                        project (you'll see some tomorrow!)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I wanted to create something a bit interesting for this,
                        so I actually started messing with cubic splines. My
                        goal was to generate a random point, compute some
                        curvature to that point, and draw a trail of a dot going
                        through. If the dot passes through a giant circle in the
                        middle, the trail would become red, and outside it would
                        be blue.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I like the effect, though it was probably a better idea
                        for me to have messed with making a particle physics
                        engine. Right now, the point bounces around and modifies
                        its velocity in a linear way, thus leading to these
                        really bumpy transitions. I would have much preferred
                        modifying the point's acceleration, which is something
                        that (had I had more time) I would have implemented.

                        This prompt was extremely hard, as plants themselves
                        don't really have any easy ways of being generated. On
                        top of that, I added the personal requirement that this
                        must be an HTML5 Canvas-only structure - no images, no
                        moving outside of the Canvas. Just math.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In order to add more complexity, I also turned off my
                        trusty AI co-programmer, as it was being a bit buggy and
                        unreasonable today. This made this challenge MUCH
                        harder, but I was actually keen to try it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This might have been the hardest challenge for me,
                        particularly because of all of the limitations. However,
                        I think it came out quite good. It's extremely
                        computationally intensive, though, and slows the page
                        load time. However, the interpolation looks nice, and
                        it's a one-time thing that can be clicked to refresh.

                        I had a great idea for this project to be focused
                        towards taking a song and drawing out a waveform for it.
                        I originally wanted to have an upload function for
                        uploading different files, but unfortunately I got
                        behind on Genuary and had to catch up quickly.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I was actually really worried about the functionality of
                        this being extremely poor, or hard to mess with.
                        Conceptually, I had to consume the waveform, and compute
                        the Fourier transform to get the frequencies on EVERY
                        draw call. This is... consuming, to say the least.
                        However, this was a lot easier to make than I thought it
                        would be.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The effect is really nice, though, and I quite like how
                        it turned out. I might modify it in the future to sample
                        fewer points (right now it's doing a 1024-point FFT,
                        which is default for the audio analyzer API). However,
                        I'm still happy with it.

                        The song is Zeitreise, by MarioBeatz. It was removed
                        from Soundcloud, and the fact that it's not on Spotify
                        is criminal.

                        I'm still in catchup mode, so it's nice that I have a
                        simple prompt - A flat art style that is relatively
                        simple to make.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        That being said, abstract art has never been one of my
                        personal fortes, or even one of my personal interests.
                        Such an abstract piece was a little complicated to
                        understand.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I wanted to make this piece look very paint-y, and a
                        little bit messy, so I worked in some color noise in
                        order to give that canvas-y feel. I quite like how it
                        turned out.

                    <p>
                        To be honest, I would have preferred this prompt much
                        earlier in the months. It's extremely simple and clean,
                        so I would have liked to do it much earlier, just to
                        practice the framework.

                        After a large hiatus from updating this site I felt the
                        best course of action to be creating a stupid yet simple
                        implementation. Hence, this.

                        I really wanted to do something with the scratch cat -
                        The MIT programming "language" mascot is something that
                        marked my childhood interest and introduction to the
                        wide world of programming.
                    </p>
                    <p>As such, this prompt became "As a kid, I made that!"</p>
                    <p>
                        If I were to be more bold, I would actually implement
                        something three-dimensional based on the Alice animation
                        suite from Carnegie Mellon. I worked with this a lot as
                        a child as well.
