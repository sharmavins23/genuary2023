                Every year I go into VSCode, into the command palette >
                Snippets: Configure User Snippets, and I finally acknowledge the
                year has gone by through changing the year on my MIT license for
                projects. This year, I decided to celebrate by applying that
                2023 license on something interesting.

                The site does not work on mobile, and is fitted to 1080p screens

                warned - Some of these pieces are extremely resource heavy, so
                be careful with turning on too many at once.

                As the days of January roll over, I'll be adding more and more
                here, so check back occasionally. I might do some early or some
                late, though. Still, I hope you enjoy some of these projects, as
                I personally enjoyed implementing them. Thank you for viewing!

                    <p>
                        To me, the hardest part of a project is always starting
                        out. As such, I was extremely worried about how this
                        drawing would turn out, as it would set in motion a
                        framework for the remainder of this challenge.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In this case I was especially worried - It's my first
                        time messing with HTML5 canvases, so things had to work
                        properly. Unfortunately, I ended up struggling a lot,
                        both due to basic mathematical errors and canvas
                        orientation being confusing by nature.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After browsing the internet for a bit I stumbled upon an
                        interesting video of a series of dots moving in straight
                        lines. These dots would individually move in simple
                        motions, but together they would form a complex pattern.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The effect turned out nice, though I couldn't perfectly
                        synchronize the dots together. I like the folding and
                        unfolding nature of the current design, though.
                        Different winding angles change the way the points
                        rotate in the code.

                        Not sure whose idea it was to make the literal second
                        prompt of the year an extreme hardball, but, here we
                        are.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I'm pretty sure it's not cheating if the framework is
                        made outside of the 10 minutes. Still, I'm learning, so
                        there's that!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Though, I do have to admit, I did cheat a little. I went
                        for about 11 minutes before realizing that the time was
                        over. Time flies when you're coding things!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I really wanted to continue this and add some form of
                        background, or maybe some other colors. My original idea
                        was to have dots that would expand and blur out, similar
                        to how it looks visually when you screenshare a
                        screenshare. However, instead of this image degradation
                        effect, I effectively just got a raindrop bokeh.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        GitHub Copilot was by FAR the most valuable tool when
                        writing this. I would have never finished this effect on
                        time without it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I ended up adding some finishing touches after the timer
                        ended, just to make the effect look neater.

                        My initial thoughts of this prompt were simply: "Woah,
                        this has potential. I can't wait to ruin that!"
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My idea was to create some form of Outrun-esque
                        structure, and add glitches to get the desired effect.
                        However, I wasn't exactly sure how I would implement
                        "glitches" or "bugs", so I had to improvise. I also
                        turned down the FPS of this display, which actually
                        helped a lot to give a retro/old unpolished computer
                        feel.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        While drawing certain things I noticed that I needed a
                        3D-esque feel. Rather than doing the math, I knee-jerk
                        asked Copilot to design something. It made something so
                        ugly that it looked like a genuine glitch, so I made
                        those occur on a very low chance and kept them in. The
                        "buildings" add this interesting effect - They pop in
                        and out, and sometimes are removed entirely!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I love how pseudo-interactive this design is. There's an
                        extremely small random chance for buildings to disappear
                        entirely, and that disappearance is tied to an extremely
                        small intermittent glitch. Potentially, all of the
                        buildings can disappear!

                    <p>
                        Borrowing the concepts from the day before, I wanted to
                        generate some form of dynamic intersection art. So, I
                        had the idea of spawning two random points (with random
                        velocities), and making intersections occur.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This is actually the first big "failure" art piece I
                        implemented, and I fiddled around with getting it to
                        work for a while. Basically, I was checking collisions
                        or intersections by checking the pixel data at the next
                        point, but certain random trajectories would screw this
                        up. I tried reimplementing it with a grid of known
                        positions, but that didn't work either - Unfortunately,
                        HTML5 canvas is not pixel-based, and will take in
                        floating points as well, so the structure fell apart
                        quickly.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Still, I quite like the effect! Points will bounce
                        around, and at a certain point when there's enough on
                        the screen the piece will devolve into pure chaos
                        quickly.

                        This one was by far a no-brainer. I spent a lot of time
                        in the prior days logging things to the console, so I
                        figured I would just make a wrapper for logging and
                        print out any log statements into this block.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The prior implementations were all done with HTML5
                        Canvas, so this was the first major departure from that
                        structure. This entire portion instead utilized a div,
                        but injected information via JavaScript. It also had
                        separate CSS, which was an interesting addition.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This also meant that I had to rewrite logging messages
                        into my prior implementations, which was an interesting
                        task, to say the least.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I quite like the idea that this piece is basically not
                        "art" in the general sense; However, it will still
                        evolve alongside more and more pieces being added in the
                        future, which I think is extremely cool.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It's also relatively quirky, and faithful to the prompt,
                        which I think is a great thing overall.
