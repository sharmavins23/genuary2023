                Every year I go into VSCode, into the command palette >
                Snippets: Configure User Snippets, and I finally acknowledge the
                year has gone by through changing the year on my MIT license for
                projects. This year, I decided to celebrate by applying that
                2023 license on something interesting.

                        To me, the hardest part of a project is always starting
                        out. As such, I was extremely worried about how this
                        drawing would turn out, as it would set in motion a
                        framework for the remainder of this challenge.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In this case I was especially worried - It's my first
                        time messing with HTML5 canvases, so things had to work
                        properly. Unfortunately, I ended up struggling a lot,
                        both due to basic mathematical errors and canvas
                        orientation being confusing by nature.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After browsing the internet for a bit I stumbled upon an
                        interesting video of a series of dots moving in straight
                        lines. These dots would individually move in simple
                        motions, but together they would form a complex pattern.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The effect turned out nice, though I couldn't perfectly
                        synchronize the dots together. I like the folding and
                        unfolding nature of the current design, though.
                        Different winding angles change the way the points
                        rotate in the code.

                        Not sure whose idea it was to make the literal second
                        prompt of the year an extreme hardball, but, here we
                        are.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I'm pretty sure it's not cheating if the framework is
                        made outside of the 10 minutes. Still, I'm learning, so
                        there's that!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Though, I do have to admit, I did cheat a little. I went
                        for about 11 minutes before realizing that the time was
                        over. Time flies when you're coding things!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I really wanted to continue this and add some form of
                        background, or maybe some other colors. My original idea
                        was to have dots that would expand and blur out, similar
                        to how it looks visually when you screenshare a
                        screenshare. However, instead of this image degradation
                        effect, I effectively just got a raindrop bokeh.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        GitHub Copilot was by FAR the most valuable tool when
                        writing this. I would have never finished this effect on
                        time without it.
