# Genuary 2023

Every year I go into VSCode, into the command palette > Snippets: Configure User
Snippets, and I finally acknowledge the year has gone by through changing the
year on my MIT license for projects. This year, I decided to celebrate by
applying that 2023 license on something interesting.

From the original page: "GENUARY is an artificially generated month of time
where we build code that makes beautiful things."

This repository houses the original source code for my asynchronous following of
Genuary. Each day's picture is implemented via JavaScript, and
[HTML5's Canvas API](https://www.w3schools.com/graphics/canvas_drawing.asp). Any
animations will run at 60FPS within the browser.

In order to create a new file, the `src/example.js` file has been added. All
variables, functions, etc. have to be named separately so as to not pollute the
namespace.
